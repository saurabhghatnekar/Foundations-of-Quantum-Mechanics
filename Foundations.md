Let us start with a simple question: What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum Computing is the study of how to use quantum mechanics to do computation.
But what is quantum mechanics? And what does it have to do with computation?

# What is Mechanics?
It is the branch of physics that tells you what will happen to a body when you apply a force to it. It is the study of motion and the forces that cause motion.
Remember Newton's laws of motion? They are the foundation of classical mechanics.
We can use Newton's laws to predict the motion of a ball thrown in the air, or the motion of a rocket in space. We can also use Newton's laws to predict the motion of planets in the solar system.
But Newton's laws fail to predict the motion of very small particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, etc. This is where Quantum Mechanics comes into play.
